/*
 * Moved down from the bundle package into the core. This was not a host adapter: over 138 lines,
 * fifteen imports came from the core and six from Symfony, and those six served only two things —
 * a v7 identifier, which `ExecutionId` already makes, and the timer wake-up, which is now a port.
 * Six hosts of the selector do not go through the bundle; leaving it there would have meant as
 * many copies of the resume semantics, divergent at the first fix.
